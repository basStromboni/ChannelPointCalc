# ChannelPointCalc
I am using this as a project to help me learn coding.
The idea of this is that you can input an amount of channel points, select if the "bonus" channel point options twitch offers applies to you 
and then the file will output the amount of time you need to watch to earn said channel points based off the selections you choose.
